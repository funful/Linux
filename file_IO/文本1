Traveling Light
I was doubling over the load on my shoulders
was a weight I carried with me everyday
Crossing miles of  frustrations and rivers of raging
Picking up stones I found  along the  way
I staggered and I stumbled down
pathway of trouble I was
hauling  those  souvernirs  of  misery
And with each step taken my back was breaking
Till I found the One who took it all from me
Down by the riverside(Down by the riverside)
I laid my burdens down,Now I'm traveling light
My spirit lifted high(I found my freedom now)
I found my freedom now,And I'm traveling light
Through the darkest alleys and loneliest valleys
I was dragging those heavy chains of doubt and fear
Then with the one word spoken the locks were broken
Now He's leading me to places
Where there are no tears
Down by the riverside
(Down by the riverside)
I laid my burdens down,
Now I'm traveling light
My spirit lifted high
(I found my freedom now)
I found my freedom now
And I'm traveling light
Down by the riverside
I laid my burdens down
Now I'm traveling light
My spirit lifted high
I found my freedom now
And I'm traveling light
Down by the riverside
(Down by the riverside)
I laid my burdens down,
Now I'm traveling light
My spirit lifted high
(I found my freedom now)
I found my freedom now
And I'm traveling light
